## Project Overview

The World Life Expectancy Project is designed to provide an in-depth analysis of life expectancy data worldwide. By leveraging SQL, we can efficiently query and analyze the data to uncover meaningful trends and insights. This project showcases my SQL skills and my ability to work with complex datasets.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from reliable and publicly available datasets. These datasets include life expectancy statistics from various countries and regions, spanning multiple years. Details about the specific data sources and any preprocessing steps can be found in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
WorldLifeExpectancy/
│
├── data/
│   └──  raw_data/
│
├── scripts/
│   └── queries/
│  
└──  README.md
```
- `scripts/`: Includes SQL scripts for querying and transforming the data.
- `results/`: Stores the results of the analysis, including visualizations and reports.

## Usage

This project is intended to showcase my skills with SQL and is not meant to be installed or used by others. You are welcome to browse through the scripts and data to understand the approaches and techniques used in the analysis.
